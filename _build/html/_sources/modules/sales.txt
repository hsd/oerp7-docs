About
^^^^^

The sales functions of OpenERP 7 deals with sales leads coming into the ERP system, identifying opportunities from the leads, the quoting process, and the sales order thereof. A user may also view customers within this area, and create customers. Incoming phone calls which may lead to sales, are also logged within this section, along with scheduled calls to be made by the sales team, which may lead to a sale. A user may schedule a follow up call or meeting based off an incoming call. A user can view current products or create products if he/she has permission for it. A user can also be part of a sales team.
